1. BUILD MEX FILES
At the matlab prompt, type

>> make

to make the mex executables. You will need to have the libjpeg library
to build jpeg_read.c. Contact MATLAB and/or the supplier of your c/c++
compiler for help with compiler-related issues.


2. RUN THE PROGRAM
At the matlab prompt, type

>> graphmain

to run the COGL decoding algorithm on the cameraman image (included
with the source). The code has been tested under MATLAB R2018B. The
timing results reported in the paper are based on optimized code.

The PSNR results reported in the paper used the following parameter
values:

For QF= 5, sig=8 tau=44 alp=208
For QF=10, sig=7 tau=38 alp=128
For QF=15, sig=5 tau=38 alp=96
For QF=20, sig=5 tau=36 alp=96
For QF=30, sig=5 tau=34 alp=80
For QF=40, sig=4 tau=34 alp=80

To run the video denoising code, type

>> graphmpeg

at the matlab prompt. The PSNR results reported in the paper were
obtained using the same set of parameters for all test configurations
(i.e., T = 1, 3, or 5, and QF = 10 or 20); these parameters are:
sig=7 tau=38 rho=2 alp=140.
